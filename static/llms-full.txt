# What is OpenBoot

One command. Your Mac is ready to code.

OpenBoot is an open-source CLI that sets up your entire macOS development environment — Homebrew packages, GUI apps, shell config, dotfiles, and macOS preferences — in minutes instead of hours.

## What You Get

- **Packages & Apps** — Install CLI tools (`node`, `go`, `docker`, `ripgrep`...) and GUI apps (`VS Code`, `Chrome`, `Warp`...) from Homebrew, all at once
- **Shell Configuration** — Oh-My-Zsh with plugins, a clean theme, and useful aliases, configured automatically
- **Dotfiles** — Clone and link your dotfiles repo so your personal config follows you to any machine
- **macOS Preferences** — Developer-friendly system settings (fast key repeat, Finder path bar, Dock icon size...) applied in one pass
- **Snapshot** — Capture your current Mac's setup and turn it into a shareable config URL

## How It Works

**Install via Homebrew (recommended):**

```bash
brew tap openbootdotdev/tap
brew install openboot
openboot
```

**Or use the one-line installer:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://openboot.dev/install.sh | bash
```

The installer:

1. Installs Xcode Command Line Tools and Homebrew (if needed)
2. Downloads the `openboot` binary
3. Launches an interactive TUI where you pick your packages
4. Installs everything, configures your shell, and applies macOS preferences

Already have your Mac set up? Run `openboot snapshot` to capture what you have and share it.

## Three Ways to Use It

**Start from a preset** — Choose `minimal`, `developer`, or `full`. Each is a curated package set you can customize in the TUI before installing.

**Create a custom config** — Build your own setup on the dashboard, then share it as a one-line install URL. Great for teams.

**Snapshot your existing Mac** — Scan your installed packages, shell config, and preferences. Upload to openboot.dev or save locally.

## System Requirements

- **macOS 12 (Monterey)** or later
- **Apple Silicon** and **Intel** Macs supported
- Internet connection
- Admin privileges (you'll be prompted when needed)

# Quick Start

Pick the path that fits your situation.

## Installation

### Homebrew (Recommended)

If you already have Homebrew installed:

```bash
brew tap openbootdotdev/tap
brew install openboot
```

Then run `openboot` to start the interactive setup.

### One-Line Installer

If you don't have Homebrew yet, or prefer the all-in-one installer:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://openboot.dev/install.sh | bash
```

This installer will:
- Install Xcode Command Line Tools (if needed)
- Install Homebrew (if needed)
- Download and run OpenBoot

## New Mac? Bootstrap It

After installing OpenBoot using either method above, run:

```bash
openboot
```

The TUI opens with the `developer` preset pre-selected. Use **arrow keys** to navigate, **Space** to toggle packages, **Enter** to confirm. After installation, restart your terminal or run `source ~/.zshrc`.

Want a different starting point? Use `--preset`:

```bash
openboot --preset minimal
openboot --preset full
```

## Already Set Up? Snapshot It

Capture your current Mac's dev environment and save it:

```bash
openboot snapshot
```

Snapshot scans your Homebrew packages, macOS preferences, shell config, and git settings. You'll review everything in a TUI editor before uploading or saving locally.

After uploading, you get a shareable URL:

```
curl -fsSL https://openboot.dev/yourname/my-setup/install.sh | bash
```

## Team Setup? Share a Config

If you're setting up a team's standard environment:

1. **Create a config** on the dashboard — pick a base preset, add/remove packages, set up custom scripts
2. **Share installation instructions** in your README or onboarding docs:

```bash
brew tap openbootdotdev/tap && brew install openboot
openboot --user yourteam/frontend
```

Or use the one-line installer as an alternative:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://openboot.dev/yourteam/frontend/install.sh | bash
```

3. **New team members** run the commands and get your exact setup

# Presets

Three curated starting points. Pick one, then customize it in the TUI before installing — add what you want, remove what you don't.

## At a Glance

| | minimal | developer | full |
|---|---------|-----------|------|
| **Best for** | Minimalists, servers | Most developers | Polyglot / DevOps |
| **CLI tools** | 19 | 29 | 48 |
| **GUI apps** | 5 | 14 | 25 |
| **NPM packages** | 0 | 5 | 9 |
| **Includes** | Essentials | Essentials + languages + editors | Everything |

## minimal

CLI essentials. Fast and lightweight.

**CLI tools:** curl, wget, jq, yq, ripgrep, fd, bat, eza, fzf, zoxide, htop, btop, tree, tealdeer, gh, git-delta, git-lfs, lazygit, stow

**GUI apps:** Warp, Raycast, Maccy, Stats, Rectangle

```bash
openboot --preset minimal
```

## developer

The recommended starting point. Everything you need to start building, nothing you don't.

**Adds over minimal:**
- **CLI:** node, go, pnpm, docker, docker-compose, lazydocker, tmux, neovim, httpie, pre-commit
- **GUI:** VS Code, OrbStack, Chrome, Arc, Postman, Notion, Scroll Reverser, TablePlus, AppCleaner
- **NPM:** typescript, tsx, eslint, prettier, nodemon

```bash
openboot --preset developer
```

## full

Complete dev environment. Languages, DevOps, databases, AI tools — all of it.

**Adds over developer:**
- **CLI:** python, uv, rustup, deno, bun, cmake, kubectl, helm, k9s, terraform, awscli, sqlite, postgresql, redis, duckdb, ollama, llm, tig, dive
- **GUI:** Cursor, Firefox, Proxyman, Obsidian, Figma, IINA, Keka, AlDente, ngrok, Shottr, Miniconda
- **NPM:** pm2, serve, vercel, wrangler

```bash
openboot --preset full
```

## Customizing During Install

Presets are just the starting selection. When the TUI launches:

1. The preset's packages come **pre-selected**
2. Use **arrow keys** to navigate, **Tab** to switch between formulae and casks
3. Press **Space** to toggle any package on or off
4. Press **Enter** to confirm and install

## Skipping the TUI

For scripted installs, use `--silent` to install a preset exactly as defined:

```bash
openboot --preset developer --silent
```

Preview what would be installed first with `--dry-run`:

```bash
openboot --preset developer --dry-run
```

---

# Snapshot

Capture your current Mac's dev environment and turn it into a shareable config — without building anything from scratch.

```
openboot snapshot
```

## What It Captures

| Category | What's Scanned | How |
|----------|---------------|-----|
| **Homebrew Formulae** | Top-level CLI tools (not dependencies) | `brew leaves` |
| **Homebrew Casks** | All installed GUI apps | `brew list --cask` |
| **Homebrew Taps** | Third-party repositories | `brew tap` |
| **NPM Global Packages** | Globally installed npm packages | `npm list -g` |
| **macOS Preferences** | 23 whitelisted developer settings | Curated list |
| **Shell Config** | Oh-My-Zsh plugins, theme, aliases | `.zshrc` parsing |
| **Git Config** | user.name, user.email, editor, default branch | `~/.gitconfig` |
| **Dev Tools** | Go, Node.js, Python, Rust, Java, Ruby, Docker | Version detection |

> Only whitelisted data is captured. No SSH keys, API tokens, `.env` files, or credentials — ever.

## How It Works

**Step 1 — Scan.** OpenBoot scans your system with real-time progress.

**Step 2 — Review.** A full-screen TUI editor lets you customize what's included:
- **Tabs**: Formulae, Casks, NPM Packages, macOS Preferences
- **Space** to toggle individual items on/off
- **`/`** to search, **`a`** to select all in a category

**Step 3 — Save.** Choose where it goes:
- **Upload to openboot.dev** — get a shareable install URL
- **Save locally** — stored at `~/.openboot/snapshot.json`

## Flags

| Flag | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `--dry-run` | Preview what would be captured, without saving or uploading |
| `--json` | Output snapshot as JSON to stdout — great for piping to `jq` |
| `--local` | Save to `~/.openboot/snapshot.json` instead of uploading |
| `--import <path>` | Restore from a local file or URL |

## Privacy & Safety

- **Paths sanitized** — home directory references replaced with `~/`
- **Whitelisted preferences only** — no arbitrary system data is read
- **No secrets captured** — SSH keys, tokens, credentials are never included
- **Full control** — you review and deselect anything before uploading

---

# Custom Configs

Build your own setup, save it on openboot.dev, and share it as a one-line install command. Anyone with the URL can install your exact environment.

## Creating a Config

1. **Sign in** with GitHub or Google
2. Go to your **Dashboard**
3. Click **Create Config**
4. Pick a **base preset** (`minimal`, `developer`, or `full`) as your starting point
5. **Add or remove packages** using the search
6. Save

## What a Config Can Include

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Homebrew formulae** | CLI tools installed via `brew install` |
| **Homebrew casks** | GUI apps installed via `brew install --cask` |
| **Custom scripts** | Shell commands that run after packages install (SSH setup, repo cloning, etc.) |
| **Dotfiles repo** | A Git URL — gets cloned and linked with `stow` |
| **macOS preferences** | Whitelisted system settings (Dock, Finder, key repeat, etc.) |

## Sharing

Every config gets a URL:

```
curl -fsSL https://openboot.dev/sarah/frontend-team/install.sh | bash
```

You can also install via the CLI directly:

```
openboot --user sarah/frontend-team
```

## Visibility

| Visibility | Listed on Profile | Install URL | Config Page |
|------------|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| **Public** | Yes | Works for everyone | Viewable by anyone |
| **Unlisted** (default) | No | Works for everyone | Viewable with direct link |
| **Private** | No | Requires auth | Owner only |

---

# Dotfiles & Shell

OpenBoot configures your shell environment and can link your dotfiles — so your personal setup follows you to any Mac.

## Shell Configuration

OpenBoot sets up **Zsh** with **Oh-My-Zsh** automatically:
- **Plugins**: git, zsh-autosuggestions, zsh-syntax-highlighting
- **Theme**: A clean, informative prompt
- **Aliases**: Common shortcuts for developer workflows

If you already have Oh-My-Zsh installed, OpenBoot merges its plugin recommendations without overwriting your existing config.

### Skipping Shell Setup

```
openboot --shell skip
```

## Dotfiles

If you keep your config files in a Git repo (`.zshrc`, `.gitconfig`, `.vimrc`, etc.), OpenBoot can clone and link them automatically.

### How It Works

1. Set a **dotfiles repo URL** in your config (via the dashboard or config JSON)
2. During install, OpenBoot clones the repo to `~/.dotfiles`
3. Files are symlinked into your home directory using GNU Stow

### Dotfiles Modes

| Mode | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `clone` | Clone the repo to `~/.dotfiles` |
| `link` | Clone and symlink with `stow` |
| `skip` | Don't touch dotfiles |

## macOS Preferences

OpenBoot applies a curated set of developer-friendly macOS settings. These are all reversible system preferences — nothing destructive.

Settings include: show all file extensions, fast key repeat, Finder path bar, show hidden files, clean Dock, screenshots to ~/Screenshots as PNG, Safari developer menu, TextEdit plain text mode.

# FAQ

## Is OpenBoot free?

Yes — free and open source (MIT license). Create configs, use snapshot, share setups, all at no cost.

## Why not just use Homebrew directly?

Homebrew installs packages. OpenBoot sets up your **entire** environment — packages, GUI apps, shell configuration, dotfiles, and macOS preferences — in one command.

## Should I use Homebrew or the one-line installer?

**Use Homebrew** if you already have it and want cleaner updates. **Use the one-line installer** on a fresh Mac or in CI/automation.

## Is the one-line installer safe?

The install script is open source, hosted on Cloudflare Workers over HTTPS, with zero telemetry. Binary is downloaded from GitHub Releases with SHA256 checksum verification.

## What if I already have Homebrew?

OpenBoot detects existing Homebrew installs and skips the setup. It also skips already-installed packages.

## Can I use it without an account?

Yes. No account needed for presets, TUI, or local snapshots. Account needed only for uploading configs and installing private configs.

## How do I update OpenBoot?

Homebrew: `brew upgrade openboot`. One-line installer: `openboot update --self`.

## How do I uninstall OpenBoot?

1. Remove binary: `brew uninstall openboot` or `rm -f ~/.openboot/bin/openboot`
2. Remove data: `rm -rf ~/.openboot`
3. Clean up shell config (optional): remove `# OpenBoot additions` block from `~/.zshrc`

## Does it work on Linux?

Not yet. macOS-only. Linux support is being explored.

## Can I use it with my existing dotfiles?

Yes. Set your dotfiles repo URL in your config and OpenBoot will clone and link it with GNU Stow. No special format required.
